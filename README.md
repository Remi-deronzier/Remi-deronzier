- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Remi-deronzier
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the field of connected objects as well as mobile apps related to endurance sport. Indeed, I am a passionate triathlete.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a junior fullstack web and mobile developer. I am specialized in Javascript (`Node.js`, `React`, `React native`, `Expo`, `Express` and `MongoDB`) and Flutter for mobile app development. Always eager to learn more about the world of programming and in particular about how to properly architect your code (SOLID principle, OOP, clean code, TDD...) to make it as maintainable and scalable as possible, I decided to continue my training by specializing in Java back-end development by following the appropriate curriculum at [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/).
